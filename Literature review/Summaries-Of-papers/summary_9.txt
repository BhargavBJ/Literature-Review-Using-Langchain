Title: Handling Cold-Start Collaborative Filtering with Reinforcement Learning

Okay, here's a summary of the research paper, broken down by section:

**Abstract:**

*   The paper addresses the cold-start problem in recommender systems, specifically for new users.
*   It proposes using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to learn an optimal sequence of questions to ask cold-start users in a movie recommender system to create user profiles.
*   The DQN model aims to generalize across different types of recommender systems.

**Introduction:**

*   Recommender systems use various methods like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches to suggest movies.
*   A major challenge is the cold-start problem, where there's a lack of information about new users.
*   The paper proposes using deep reinforcement learning to learn an optimal interview process, where the system dynamically generates questions to maximize information gain based on user responses.
*   This is presented as the first work using reinforcement learning for this kind of adaptive interview process.

**Methodology:**

*   The system uses Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (BPMF) to create movie embeddings from existing user ratings.
*   A Deep Q-Network (DQN) is used to generate interview questions of the form "Do you like λ?", where λ is a movie. Users respond with a rating (1-5) or indicate they haven't seen the movie (rating 0).
*   The DQN dynamically generates subsequent questions based on previous answers.
*   After the interview, the question-answer pairs are fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to generate a predicted user embedding.
*   Movie ratings are predicted using a function of user and movie embeddings.
*   The DQN's state is a representation of the question-answer pairs. The action space is the set of all movies.
*   The DQN is trained using the inverse of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the movie rating predictions as the reward. A modified Q-function update prevents repeating questions.
*   The MLP is trained in two ways: (1) using user embeddings from the BPMF model as the true value, and (2) directly on user's actual movie ratings.
